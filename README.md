# Financial Risk Analysis for Loan Approval Using Python

## Project Overview

This project applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to assess financial risk for loan approval decisions. Using the dataset from [Kaggleâ€™s Financial Risk for Loan Approval](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lorenzozoppelletto/financial-risk-for-loan-approval), the workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building to predict whether loan applicants pose a high or low risk. The project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and predictive modeling in financial services to improve decision-making and minimize risk.
